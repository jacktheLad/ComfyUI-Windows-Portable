# Development Memo - Version Upgrades

__Translated by ChatGPT__

To facilitate rapid development and debugging, I hardcoded the parameterized processes originally written by comfy into version numbers. Automatic updates are no longer feasible, but fortunately, the repository is not large, so a simple search and replace will do. Note that the field of AI changes rapidly and extensively, inevitably requiring some manual follow-up.

.Updating PIP Dependencies
* Run `bash generate-requirements.sh`.
* Then manually check `requirements.txt` and `requirements2.txt`.
Some nodes' dependencies are quite tricky, requiring manual selection to ensure that they don't conflict during installation and can still run in the end.

.Upgrading Python Patch Versions(https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/)
* Search and replace `3.13.2`.

.Upgrading Python Minor Versions
* Search and replace `3.13.2`.
* Search and replace `3.13`.
* Search and replace `cp312`.
* Search and replace `py312`.
* Search and replace `python312`.
* Finally, search `312` to see if anything was missed.

.Upgrading CUDA Versions
* Search and replace `cu121`.
* Search and replace `12.1`.

.Checking Files
* CI starts ComfyUI before packaging, to let custom nodes download model files (a common first-run behavior).
* However, some nodes/Py packages generate some localized files at startup (such as configuration files containing absolute paths), which are cleared during the "Clean up" section of `step2.sh`.
* Changing dependencies or adding custom nodes may cause changes to these files; use Sandboxie to monitor file changes during runtime and make additions or modifications.
